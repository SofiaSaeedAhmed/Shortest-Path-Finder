# Path Finding Algorithm Visualisation
This Python application helps you visualize the famous algorithms: _Dijkstra_ and _A* Search_.

We made use of `Pygame` to set up the screens.

## Setting up:
Make sure to import the Pygame library using `pip install pygame`
Run the `code.py` file

## How it works?
1- A landing screen will launch as soon as you run the code. Background music has been added to improve user experience.

2- Read the instructions and click anywhere on the screen to proceed.

3- Click on any box to make a starting point and then click somewhere to make an endpoint of the path.

4- Draw barriers on the screen for more complexity.

5- Keyboard clicks: Press 1 for A* Search visualization and 2 for Dijksra visualization.

6- See the path form.

7- press 'c' to clear the screen

Purple is the shortest path.

Green boxes indicate the points taken into account while searching

Orange boxes indicated the boundary of search
