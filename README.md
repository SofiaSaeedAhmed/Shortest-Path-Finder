# Path Finding Algorithm Visualisation
This Python application helps you visualize the famous algorithms: _Dijkstra_ and _A* Search_.

We made use of `Pygame` to set up the screens.

## Setting up:
Make sure to import the Pygame library using `pip install pygame`
Run the `code.py` file

## How it works?
1- A landing screen will launch as soon as you run the code. Background music has been added to improve user experience.
2- Read the instructions and click anywhere on the screen to proceed.
3- Click on any box to make a starting point and then click somewhere to make an endpoint of the path.
4- Draw barriers on the screen for more complexity.
5- Keyboard clicks: Press 1 for A* Search visualization and 2 for Dijksra visualization.
6- See the path form.
7- press 'c' to clear the screen
